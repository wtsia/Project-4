## Goals

<i>Include a short paragraph describing the project and its intended audience.</i>

This project is a bug tracker where users can 

The intended audience of this project is for developers who wish to keep track of bugs and post issues to be fixed.

## Functional Description

<i>What does the application do? What application states (high-level descriptions of core user scenarios) will the user encounter?

For example, your functional description might look like:

First Run
Creating a New _____ (game, search, etc.)
Operations
Background and Foreground Behavior</i>

## User Interface

<i>Include wireframes for each page, with detailed descriptions of:

Each control, including states (enabled/disabled/highlighted) and operations.

Supported orientations and transitions between them.
Functionality represented.

Error handling.

Dimensions and constraints.

Here are the wireframes related to my latest iOS app, NotifEye:</i>

## Milestones

<i>As described above, deadlines for completion and expected deliverables.

For example, the milestones section in your design document template might look like:

Facade Application showing screen and with temporary transitions and example images/text
Communication Protocol: application connects to network/server
Functional Milestone 1: …
Alpha Application (with full functionality)
Stability
Release</i>

## Relevance
<i>I don’t mean to imply that the design phase is over once you and your client have agreed upon a specification document. There will always be details that neither of you had considered, and both you and the client will, while looking at the intermediate results, encounter new ideas, design changes, unexpected design flaws, and unworkable suggestions.

The design will evolve, and the changes should be captured in your document. In my 25 years of experience, I have never once worked on a project where this didn’t happen—and that includes my own applications (i.e., where I was my own client). Even then, I created a design document with detailed specifications, and adjusted it as necessary.

Above all, keep in touch. At least several times a week, contact your client, report on your progress, ask for clarification, and make certain that you share identical visions. As a litmus test for your communication, try and ensure that you and your client give the same answers to these three questions:

What was the developer just working on?
What is the developer currently working on?
What will the developer work on next?<i>
